Hello, this time I craeted a Covid-19 Table showing confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing ,etc.

This table shows data of all states and Union Territories, along with districts of each state.

This project is created using ReactJS, in which table is created using Material UI.

This time I created this project using React CDN links, instead of create-react-app.

I have used CDN links to ReactJS, MaterialUI and Material UI Icons.
